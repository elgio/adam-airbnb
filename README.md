# Amsterdam AirBNB Analysis Project
Data analysis project using Amsterdam AirBNB data

This project was a first try at using Tableau and R for data analysis

The central question of this project was: For an investor looking to buy property for an AirBNB in Amsterdam, what neighborhood and property type should they focus on?

Additional questions investigated as part of the data analysis included:

   1. Which Property Types receive the most positive reviews?
   2. Prompt
   3. Prompt

Elements for future analysis:

   1. Ensure reviews by property type is normalized to a percent of properties
   2. Clean and code geodata on public transport stops
   3. Analyze revenue as a function of proximity to transport stop, type of transport stop 
   4. Locate data on house price per neighborhood/postcode in Amsterdam as house price will affect revenue
